    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p class="bio">
        I am an amateur data scientist and machine learning practitioner.
        I have a Bsc in Mechanical Engineering, but the variety of problems
        I'm interested in applying ML and Data Science tools to is quite broad.
        Below are a few of the personal projects I've been involved in.

        <h2>Machine Reliability Prediction Using Sound</h2>
        <p>This is a model that, given a sound clip from an operating machine,
            can classify that operation as either normal, or abnormal.
            It is trained using data from the MIMII machine sound dataset,
            which contains sounds from several classes of machines.  </p>

        <h2>Solar Power Prediction (AMII ML Technician Course)</h2>
        <p>This is the final presentation created by my team in the AMII ML
            Technician Course. Our team was given a dataset, and over the
            course we spent time scoping out, and evaluating an business
            case for an ML solution, then analyzing the data and building
            and evaluating an appropriate model.</p>

        <h2>Skin Cancer Detection Webapp (UAIS)</h2>
        <p>A web application where the user can compete against a convolutional
            neural network to see who can more accurately identify whether
            presented pictures of possibly cancerous skin lesions are malignant
            or benign. This project was done with the Undergraduate AI Society
            at the University of Alberta, for the AI in Medicine Student
            Society Symposium.<br><br><em> Note: the currently linked
            version of the webapp uses pre-computed predictions. </em></p>
