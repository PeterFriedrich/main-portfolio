    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p class="bio">
        I am a data scientist and machine learning practitioner.
        I have a Bsc in Mechanical Engineering, but the variety of problems
        I'm interested in applying ML and Data Science tools to is quite broad.
        Below are a few of the personal projects I've been involved in.

    <div id="nursing">
        <h2>Nursing Home Diaper IoT Monitoring: Omdena, DriQ Health</h2>
        <p>This project was done as a volunteer ML Engineer for Omdena, a datascience volunteering platform. The client was a startup in the healthcare monitoring space called DriQ Health. Their mission was to develop a system that would allow nursing home staff to determine if seniors were wearing wet diapers without having to check them manually. Seniors left to wear unchanged briefs for extended periods are at risk of skin breakdown, and dangerous urinary tract infections.

    <div id="carbon">
        <h2>Soil Organic Carbon Modelling: Omdena, Azolla Projects</h2>
        <p>This project was done as a volunteer Junior ML Engineer for Omdena,
            a datascience volunteering platform. The client was a startup in the
            regenerative agriculture space named Azolla Projects. Their mission was to help
            farmers transition to regenerative agriculture methods, since these methods
            can decrease a farm's carbon emission, thereby generating carbon credits
            that can be sold in carbon markets. We were tasked with creating tools to
            specifically visualize and predict the effect of certain methods on a given plot's
            soil organic carbon (SOC). I was involved in data acquisition and research, and
            was one of the main members of the modeling team.

    <div id="reliability">
        <h2>Machine Reliability Prediction Using Sound (Unfinished)</h2>
        <p>This is a model that, given a sound clip from an operating machine,
            can classify that operation as either normal, or abnormal.
            It is trained using data from the MIMII machine sound dataset,
            which contains sounds from several classes of machines.  </p>

    <div id="solar">
        <h2>Solar Power Prediction (AMII ML Technician Course)</h2>
        <p>This is the final presentation created by my team in the AMII ML
            Technician Course. Our team was given a dataset, and over the
            course we spent time scoping out, and evaluating an business
            case for an ML solution, then analyzing the data and building
            and evaluating an appropriate model.</p>

        <h2>Skin Cancer Detection Webapp (UAIS)</h2>
        <p>A web application where the user can compete against a convolutional
            neural network to see who can more accurately identify whether
            presented pictures of possibly cancerous skin lesions are malignant
            or benign. This project was done with the Undergraduate AI Society
            at the University of Alberta, for the AI in Medicine Student
            Society Symposium.<br><br><em> Note: the currently linked
            version of the webapp uses pre-computed predictions. </em></p>
