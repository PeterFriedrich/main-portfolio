                I'm a data scientist and machine learning practitioner.
                I have a Bsc in Mechanical Engineering, but the variety of problems
                I'm interested in applying ML and Data Science tools to is quite broad.
                Below are a few of the projects I've been involved in.

            <h2>Nursing Home Brief IoT Monitoring: Omdena, DriQ Health</h2>
                <p>This project was done as a volunteer ML Engineer for Omdena,
                a datascience volunteering platform. The client was a startup in the
                healthcare monitoring space called DriQ Health. Their mission was to develop
                a system that would allow nursing home staff to determine if seniors
                were wearing wet diapers without having to check them manually.
                Seniors left to wear unchanged briefs for extended periods are at
                risk of skin breakdown, and dangerous urinary tract infections.<br>
                I was involved in the dataset creation and labeling pipeline, and model evaluation.

            <h2>Soil Organic Carbon Modelling: Omdena, Azolla Projects</h2>
                <p>This project was done as a volunteer Junior ML Engineer for Omdena,
                    a datascience volunteering platform. The client was a startup in
                    the regenerative agriculture space named Azolla Projects. Their
                    mission was to help farmers transition to regenerative agriculture
                    methods, since these methods can decrease a farm's carbon emission,
                    thereby generating carbon credits that can be sold in carbon
                    markets. We were tasked with creating tools to specifically
                    visualize and predict the effect of certain methods on a
                    given plot's soil organic carbon (SOC). I was involved in 
                    data acquisition and research, and was one of the main
                    members of the modeling team.

            <h2>Machine Reliability Prediction Using Sound (Unfinished)</h2>
                <p>This is a model that, given a sound clip from an operating machine,
                    can classify that operation as either normal, or abnormal.
                    It is trained using data from the MIMII machine sound dataset,
                    which contains sounds from several classes of machines.

                <p>This is the final presentation created by my team in the AMII ML
                    Technician Course. Our team was given a dataset, and over the
                    course we spent time scoping out, and evaluating an business
                    case for an ML solution, then analyzing the data and building
                    and evaluating an appropriate model.
