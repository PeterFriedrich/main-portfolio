    <p class="bio">
    I'm an amateur data scientist and machine learning practitioner. I have a Bsc in Mechanical Engineering, but the variety of problems I'm interested in applying ML and Data Science tools to is quite broad. Below are a few of the personal projects I've been involved in.

    <div id="survey">
        <h2>Survey Data Analysis/Exploration</h2>
        <p>This was inspired by work done at the Data4Good National Hackathon. It's a combination of some of my own exploration there, things I didn't get around to doing, and interesting techniques I saw other teams apply.</p>

    <div id="skin">
        <h2>Skin Cancer Detection Webapp</h2>
        <p>A web application where the user can compete against a convolutional neural network to see who can more accurately identify whether presented pictures of possibly cancerous skin lesions are malignant or benign. This project was done with the Undergraduate AI Society at the University of Alberta, for the AI in Medicine Student Society Symposium.<br><br><em> Note: the currently linked version of the webapp uses pre-computed predictions. </em></p>
